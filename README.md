# weather-app
This is a weather app which uses the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch weather data and display it to the user.

To use, simply enter a location into the search bar and if the location is valid, it will update the UI elements to display the weather at said location.

Check out the live demo here! https://jhuang38.github.io/weather-app/

The UI was built with the help of a friend who's awesome with art!
